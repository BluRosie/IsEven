## Mission Statement

A simple Java program to determine a number's divisibility by two without the use of unintuitive operations (`%`).

## Usage

`IsEven.java` is the primary program. `Config.java` is used to scale `IsEven.java`'s range. This allows for the a trade-off between range, size and time.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
